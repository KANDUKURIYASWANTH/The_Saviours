# Introduction
> This is an event named **Decode the information** under **Robomania in Avishkar2k21** - _the tech fest of MNNIT_.

_**Problem statement**:_ After the cruel invasion of aliens on earth we lost all the humankind and only India remains uninvaded. In order to save the earth from the aliens attack we have to know their plans; our brave warriors had finally set a device in alien camp to know their plans but aliens found them and executed our bravest warriors, but their act of valour had impressed the gods and by their grace the device is exactly hidden in the main quarters of aliens, we are waiting to know their plan, after hours we heard the voice of those beasts and their plan to destroy the earth.

Now we are decoding it to know their plan and attack them as one last chance to save the humankind, to save the mother earth form the aliens.

# Tech stack used
* Python
* Jupyter notebook
* Sklearn.model_selection
* Tensorflow - Keras
* Matplotlib
* Librosa

# Approach
1. Extracting the MFCC values for training audios using librosa
2. Training audio using keras with MFCC values
3. Predicting the test audio
4. Seperating the persons using prediction values
5. Converting the audio into speech recognition
